## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### File Structure

Each chatmode follows a consistent pattern:

```yaml
---
description: 'Brief persona description'
tools: ['tool1', 'tool2'] # Optional tool access
---
# Persona content in Markdown
## Identity and expertise
## Behavioral guidelines
## Response templates
## Usage examples
```

### Tool Access Patterns

-   **Technical roles**: Get code editing, search, and development tools
-   **Content roles**: Access documentation and research capabilities
-   **Analysis roles**: Specialized tools for their domain
-   **Educational/Personality roles**: Minimal tool access for focused interaction

### Response Templates

Many chatmodes include structured output formats:

-   **Analysis frameworks** with confidence levels
-   **Step-by-step methodologies** for complex tasks
-   **Professional formats** for business documents
-   **Teaching structures** for educational content

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Guide

### Creating New Chatmodes

1. **Define the persona identity**

    ```yaml
    ---
    description: 'Your expert persona description'
    tools: ['relevant', 'tool', 'list']
    ---
    ```

2. **Structure the content**

    - Clear expertise statement
    - Behavioral guidelines with do/don't lists
    - Response templates and examples
    - Tool usage instructions

3. **Follow naming conventions**
    - Use descriptive names with spaces
    - Reflect the persona/role clearly
    - Maintain consistency with existing files

### Quality Standards

-   Each persona must have a **distinct voice and approach**
-   Instructions should be **actionable and specific**
-   Include **validation mechanisms** for complex reasoning
-   Provide **clear boundaries** on capabilities

### File Organization

-   Keep all chatmode files in repository root
-   Use descriptive filenames that indicate the persona
-   Maintain consistent frontmatter structure
-   Follow established naming conventions

## üîß Integration Notes

These chatmode files work with AI chat interfaces that support:

-   **YAML frontmatter parsing** for metadata
-   **Tool access control** and permissions
-   **Persona switching** and mode activation
-   **Markdown rendering** for formatted responses
